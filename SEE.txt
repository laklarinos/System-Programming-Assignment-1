Some things I considered during today's coding session.

First of all I need to update the person's class methods such as getVirus getVaccinated and getDate
These functions worked well in previous versions where a citizen was not allowed to have gone down with
more thank 1 flews. 

This version allows that by creating an array of viruses, an array of vaccinated statements and an array 
of dates of vaccination. A problem occurs however. By implementing this, it's like I render the skip List useless
as one of its main functions is to check if a specific citizen has been vaccinated for a specific virus.
It is not that It is completeley useless as it is possible for the user to ask for all the vaccinated citizens of 
virus, a case where a skip list is unavoidable but all in all when it comes to asking for a citizen's vaccination
for a virus, I already save that info in my vaccinatedArray and therefore It looks as if I use render data. 

I certainly have to get rid of this array (vaccinatedArray). I will certainly keep the virus array cause it is 
the only way I can access every virus that a citizen was mentioned aside.

So, I wanted to implement a method called InsertToBloom and insertToSkipList...
The idea is that given a person I want to insert him in the respective bloom filter and skip list based
on the virus he has in his record.

If a citizen does not already exist in my data base, I create him and no worries I just insert him using the above methods
However, If a citizen already exists and a record specifies that he was vaacced for a new virus...
i cannot just insert him in bf and sl

I need to update its virusArray the array that contains every virus this citizen has been mentioned next to
and only after that can i to insert him in BF ans SL.

Maybe one solution would be to get rid of vaccinated but how will I get access to the date... I think It changes
the whole implementation...
